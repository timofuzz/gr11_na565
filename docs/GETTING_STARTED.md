# Getting Started
The dataset configs are located within [tools/cfgs/dataset_configs](../tools/cfgs/dataset_configs), 
and the model configs are located within [tools/cfgs](../tools/cfgs) for different datasets. 


### KITTI Dataset
* Please download the official [KITTI 3D object detection](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_object.php?obj_benchmark=3d) dataset and organize the downloaded files as follows (the road planes could be downloaded from [[road plane]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d5mq0RXRnvHPVeKx6Q612z0YRO1t2wAp/view?usp=sharing), which are optional for data augmentation in the training):
* If you would like to train [CaDDN](../tools/cfgs/kitti_models/CaDDN.yaml), download the precomputed [depth maps](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qFZux7KC_gJ0UHEg-qGJKqteE9Ivojin/view?usp=sharing) for the KITTI training set
* NOTE: if you already have the data infos from `pcdet v0.1`, you can choose to use the old infos and set the DATABASE_WITH_FAKELIDAR option in tools/cfgs/dataset_configs/kitti_dataset.yaml as True. The second choice is that you can create the infos and gt database again and leave the config unchanged.

```python 
python -m pcdet.datasets.kitti.kitti_dataset create_kitti_infos tools/cfgs/dataset_configs/kitti_dataset.yaml

## Training & Testing


### Test and evaluate the pretrained models
* Test with a pretrained model: 
```shell script
python test.py --cfg_file ${CONFIG_FILE} --batch_size ${BATCH_SIZE} --ckpt ${CKPT}
```

* To test all the saved checkpoints of a specific training setting and draw the performance curve on the Tensorboard, add the `--eval_all` argument: 
```shell script
python test.py --cfg_file ${CONFIG_FILE} --batch_size ${BATCH_SIZE} --eval_all
```

### Train a model

* Train with a single GPU:
```shell script
python train.py --cfg_file ${CONFIG_FILE}
```
